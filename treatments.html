                        <h5>Tooth Whitening</h5>
                        <p>Teeth Whitening is a process where the tooth discolouration is ‘whitened’ to a lighter shade. It removes the staining agent through chemical means. 
                            It is a safe procedure when carried out under professional supervision. 
                            Treatment results usually depend on the severity of the discolouration. 
                            <br> <br>
                            Teeth can discolour for various reasons. The dentist will recommend the most ideal method based on your oral 
                            condition after an in-office examination to establish the cause and nature of your tooth discolouration, as well as provide you 
                            with more information on the various types of whitening procedures available, duration & frequency of treatment.
                            <br> <br>
                            We offer Tooth Whitening from £350.

                        <h5>Root Canal Treatment</h5>
                        <p>There is canal in the centre of all your teeth which contains blood vessels and nerves. This is known as the root canal or canal space. 
                            Sometimes this space can become infected or inflamed due to deep tooth decay or trauma which can result in toothache or even a 
                            dental abscess. 
                            <br> <br>
                            A root canal treatment can be carried out to remove the inflamed tissues from the centre of the tooth thereby relieving the pain 
                            and allowing you to keep your tooth.
                            <br> <br>
                            We offer Root Canal Treatment from £550 but the price can very depending on various factors.

                        <p>A regular check up consists of a detailed examination of your teeth, 
                            gums and oral tissues and a conversation with your dentist where they will ask you about your overall 
                            health and lifestyle. It is important that you answer any questions as accurately as possible to 
                            ensure your dentist can give you the best advice.
                            <br> <br>
                            If you are a new patient, in addition to the regular examination you will also receive:

                        <h5>Veneers</h5>
                        <p>Veneers are porcelain facings (like false finger nails) that are held on the tooth surface by a very 
                            strong bonding agent which make teeth look natural and healthy, and because they are very thin, very 
                            little preparation of the tooth is necessary. Veneers can improve the color, shape, position of teeth, 
                            and close gaps where orthodontics is not practical.
                            <br> <br>
                            The dental veneer procedure can be completed in two dental visits over the course of 2 weeks. You can visit 
                            for comprehensive and require several hours of examination and tooth preparation at our clinic.
                            <br> <br>
                            We offer Veneers starting from £800.

                        <h5>Braces</h5>
                        <p>Fixed metal braces have been around for 50 years in their current format, with gradual improvements that have made 
                            them a dependable and safe orthodontic system. They deliver predictable results which can be aesthetically 
                            attractive and stable, protecting the long term oral health of the patient.
                            <br> <br>
                            They use blocks affixed to the surface of the teeth with wire running through them to apply force and cause gradual 
                            movement. The blocks have this programming built into them, so that the wire has predetermined slots to sit in on each tooth, 
                            and the wire develops the force that generates the movement of the teeth.
                            <br> <br>
                            We offer Braces starting from £1500 and offer monthly payment plans.</p>

                        <h5>Crowns</h5>
                        <p>Sometimes known as a cap, crowns are carefully fitted sleeves that sit over an existing tooth to protect it from further damage, 
                            and to improve your overall smile. Crowns can hold cracked teeth together and support bridges, and they are often applied as the 
                            final step in root canal treatment. They can also cover discoloured teeth to improve the appearance of your teeth.
                            <br> <br>
                            Preparation time will vary depending on the condition of the damaged tooth. Your tooth will be carefully reshaped, 
                            to ensure that it can carry the crown. Treatment is usually provided over 2 visits. After the tooth is prepared 
                            and the impression is taken at the first appointment, a temporary crown is worn to protect the tooth for around 
                            2 weeks while the crown is made.

                        <h5>Tooth Scaling</h5>
                        <p>A scale and polish will remove harmful plaque and deposits of tartar that, if left, can cause periodontal (gum) disease. 
                            By making a hygienist visit part of your dental care regime you can stay one step ahead and avoid becoming one of the 
                            19 out of every 20 people who will suffer from gum disease during their life.
                            <br> <br>
                            An appointment with one of our hygienists will involve an initial oral hygiene check up, 
                            followed by a ‘scaling’ procedure. This is where any build up of harmful plaque and tartar is carefully and gently removed 
                            from the surface of your teeth and around the gum line using scalers and curettes, which are specially 
                            designed tools to check scrape away soft deposits. Hand-held mirrors help your hygienist to spot those 
                            missed areas and pinpoint plaque build up. Following a good clean and analysis of overall gum health, they will 
                            give your teeth a shine and polish with a gentle, quiet air polisher to remove any superficial stains. 
                            In cases where there is decay, a hygienist may apply fluoride or an antibacterial gel.
                            <br> <br>
                            We offer hygienist appointments from £85.
